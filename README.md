# Contao SASS selectors for core modules

SASS files for standard ([Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org)) modules (as of version 3.5 LTS, should be capable to use with newer versions < 4.0).

With Contao 3.4 and newer there is a built in SCSS/SASS (and LESS) support. However, I use [Supertheme](https://github.com/comolo/contao-supertheme) when starting to built a site. That's because the core SASS support sometimes doesn't recognize if you have done changes or whatever. So I only use it in production when SASS is often changed.
