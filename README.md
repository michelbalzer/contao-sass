# contao-sass
SASS files for standard ([Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org)) modules (as of version 3.2, should be capable to use with newer versions < 4.0).

You can use SASS/SCSS in Contao with [Supertheme](https://github.com/comolo/contao-supertheme) which requires Composer. Maybe there are other extensions you can use, but I'm happy with it :) Also, as with Contao 3.4 there is a built in SASS/SCSS Support in Contao â€“ which is kind of strange to use with importing SASS files but I have to further investigate that.
