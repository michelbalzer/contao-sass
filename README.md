# contao-sass
SASS files for standard Contao Open Source CMS modules (as of version 3.2, should be capable to use with newer versions < 4.0

You can use SASS/SCSS in Contao with [Supertheme](https://comolo/contao-supertheme) which requires Compass. Maybe there are other extensions you can use, but I'm happy with it :)
